# Wat-A-Git

## What is it?

Wat-A-Git is a C++ Git implementation that personifies Git with the avatar of a Grumpy Old Man who provides interactive feedback through Gen-Z and Gen-Alpha talk. This project is motivated by the desire to develop my C++ skills through project-based learning, while having some fun in the process.

## High-Level Milestones

- [ ] Implement standard Git
