## What is it?

Wat-A-Git is a C++ Git implementation that personifies Git with the avatar of a Grumpy Old Man who provides interactive feedback through Gen-Z and Gen-Alpha talk. This project is motivated by the desire to develop my C++ skills through project-based learning, while having some fun in the process.

## High-Level Milestones

- [ ] Create splash screen - "Let's Git this show on the road!"
- [ ] Create a rudimentary Wat-A-Git User Interface
- [ ] Create a section for viewing the Git tree
- [ ] Make the Wat-A-Git avatar interactive when you run Git commands
